# Create a migration and apply it
npx prisma migrate dev --name NAME

# Apply all migration, then create and apply any new migrations
npx prisma migrate dev

# Apply all migrations and create a new migration if there are schema changes, but do not apply it
npx prisma migrate dev --create-only

# Deletes and recreates the database
npx prisma migrate reset

# Applies all pending migrations, creates the database if necessary
npx prisma migrate deploy

npx prisma migrate status
```
