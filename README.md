#### Notable Packages

-

## Getting Started

1. Run `npm install`
2. Rename .env.sample to .env and update the Postgres connection string
3. Run `npx prisma migrate deploy`

## Prisma Structure

./prisma/migrations - houses all migrations
./prisma/schema.prisma - this is where the database schema is defined for the migrations

## Migrations

```bash
# Create a migration and apply it
npx prisma migrate dev --name NAME

# Apply all migration, then create and apply any new migrations
npx prisma migrate dev

# Apply all migrations and create a new migration if there are schema changes, but do not apply it
npx prisma migrate dev --create-only

# Deletes and recreates the database
npx prisma migrate reset

# Applies all pending migrations, creates the database if necessary
npx prisma migrate deploy

# State of migrations in the database
npx prisma migrate status
```

# Sending Emails

## Replacement Variables

When using a template that makes use of replacement variables, the standard naming convention of the variables is @VARIABLENAME.

The system expects a pipe-delimited list of key/value pairs for replacement. For example:
`@FIRST=Craig|@LAST=Campbell`.
